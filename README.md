A list of actually decent, actually used AND appreciated in the industry C++ libraries

## Frameworks
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) - One of the most highly regarded and expertly designed C++ library projects in the world.

## Benchmarking
* [Nonius](https://nonius.io/) - A C++ micro-benchmarking framework.

## Language interop
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) - Seamless operability between C++11 and Python.
* [Sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) - Header-only C++ library binding to Lua.

## Libraries
* [cppformat](https://cppformat.github.io/latest/index.html) - An open-source formatting library for C++. It can be used as a safe alternative to printf or as a fast alternative to IOStreams.
* [date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) - A date and time library based on the C++11 (and beyond) `<chrono>` header. It also handles timezones.
* [range-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) - Range algorithms for C++11 (and beyond).

## Testing
* [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) - A modern, C++-native, header-only, framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD.

## Tools
* [Clang-Format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) - Highly integratable C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf code formatter from the Clang team.
* [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) - A programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.
* [MSYS2](https://msys2.github.io/) - provide support to facilitate using the bash shell, Autotools, revision control systems and the like for building native Windows applications using MinGW-w64 toolchains.

### Online compilers
* [Coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/) - Compile, link, run.
* [Compiler Explorer](https://gcc.godbolt.org/) - View generated assembly for many compilers.
