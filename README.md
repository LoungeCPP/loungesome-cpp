A list of actually decent, actually used AND appreciated in the industry C++ libraries

## Frameworks
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) - One of the most highly regarded and expertly designed C++ library projects in the world.

## Testing
* [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch) - A modern, C++-native, header-only, framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD.

## Tools
* [Clang-Format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) - Highly integratable C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Protobuf code formatter from the Clang team.

### Compilers
* [GNU GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) - Part of the GNU Compiler Collection, and for many the reference in terms of C++ implementations.
* [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) - A modern, modular C++ compiler, often the first to implement new C++ features. Bundled with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for Mac OS users.
* [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) - A port of the GNU GCC compiler to Windows, offering almost everything the Linux version offers.
* [Microsoft Visual C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B) - (or *MSVC*) The classic C++ compiler from Microsoft, for building Windows applications. Part of [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx), and available stand-alone as [Visual C++ Build Tools](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/11/02/announcing-visual-c-build-tools-2015-standalone-c-tools-for-build-environments.aspx).
